# `fba-inbound-eligibility-api-v1`

With the FBA Inbound Eligibility API, you can build applications that let sellers get eligibility previews for items before shipping them to Amazon's fulfillment centers. With this API you can find out if an item is eligible for inbound shipment to Amazon's fulfillment centers in a specific marketplace. You can also find out if an item is eligible for using the manufacturer barcode for FBA inventory tracking. Sellers can use this information to inform their decisions about which items to ship Amazon's fulfillment centers.

```javascript
import {SellingPartnerApiAuth} from '@sp-api-sdk/auth'
import {FbaInboundEligibilityApiClient} from '@sp-api-sdk/fba-inbound-eligibility-api-v1'

const auth = new SellingPartnerApiAuth({
  clientId: process.env.LWA_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.LWA_CLIENT_SECRET,
  refreshToken: 'Atzr|…',
  accessKeyId: '',
  secretAccessKey: '',

```

## Rate Limiting

In order to retry rate limited requests (HTTP 429), you can configure the API client as such:

```javascript
const client = new FbaInboundEligibilityApiClient({
  auth,
  region: 'eu',
  rateLimiting: {
    retry: true,
    // Optionally specify a callback that will be called on every retry.
    onRetry: (retryInfo) => {
      console.log(retryInfo)
    },
  },
})
```

The rate limits used for each route are specified in the [API documentation]((https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/tree/main/references/fba-inbound-eligibility-api/fbaInbound.md)).
