 * Selling Partner API for Reports
 * Effective **June 27, 2024**, the Selling Partner API for Reports v2020-09-04 will no longer be available and all calls to it will fail. Integrations that rely on the Reports API must migrate to [Reports v2021-06-30](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/reports-api-v2021-06-30-reference) to avoid service disruption.
