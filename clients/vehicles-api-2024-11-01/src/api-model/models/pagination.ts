/**
 * When a request produces a response that exceeds the `pageSize`, pagination occurs. This means the response is divided into individual pages. To retrieve the next page or the previous page, you must pass the `nextToken` value or the `previousToken` value as the `pageToken` parameter in the next request. When you receive the last page, there will be no `nextToken` key in the pagination object.
