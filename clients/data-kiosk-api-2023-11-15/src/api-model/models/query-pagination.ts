/**
 * When a query produces results that are not included in the data document, pagination occurs. This means the results are divided into pages. To retrieve the next page, you must pass a `CreateQuerySpecification` object with `paginationToken` set to this object\'s `nextToken` and with `query` set to this object\'s `query` in the subsequent `createQuery` request. When there are no more pages to fetch, the `nextToken` field will be absent.
