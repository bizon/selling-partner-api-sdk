 * Additional information passed to the subscription to control the processing of notifications. For example, you can use an `eventFilter` to customize your subscription to send notifications for only the specified `marketplaceId`s, or select the aggregation time period at which to send notifications (for example: limit to one notification every five minutes for high frequency notifications). The specific features available vary depending on the `notificationType`.  This feature is currently only supported by the `ANY_OFFER_CHANGED` and `ORDER_CHANGE` `notificationType`s.
