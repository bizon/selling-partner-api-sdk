 * Selling Partner API for Orders
 * The Selling Partner API for Orders helps you programmatically retrieve order information. These APIs let you develop fast, flexible, custom applications in areas like order synchronization, order research, and demand-based decision support tools. The Orders API supports orders that are two years old or less. Orders more than two years old will not show in the API response.  **Note:** The Orders API supports orders from 2016 and after for the JP, AU, and SG marketplaces.
