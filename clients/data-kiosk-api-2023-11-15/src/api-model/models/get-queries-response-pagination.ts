/**
 * When a request has results that are not included in this response, pagination occurs. This means the results are divided into pages. To retrieve the next page, you must pass the `nextToken` as the `paginationToken` query parameter in the subsequent `getQueries` request. All other parameters must be provided with the same values that were provided with the request that generated this token, with the exception of `pageSize` which can be modified between calls to `getQueries`. When there are no more pages to fetch, the `nextToken` field will be absent.
